# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a single-page, premium-feeling marketing landing page for “IDEAZS” with the specified sections, copy, styling, and interactions.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a single-page layout on the main route with sections in order: Hero, Problem Statement, How It Works, Features, Pricing, Final CTA.
- Apply the requested minimal, futuristic, premium theme (dark navy-to-black gradient background, strong typography hierarchy, glassmorphism cards, rounded corners, soft shadows, electric blue/violet glow accents).
- Implement the Hero section with the exact headline/subheadline and CTA buttons, plus a subtle animated gradient and/or floating light particle effect.
- Add Problem Statement, How It Works (3 columns desktop, stacked mobile with icons), Features (5 icon cards), Pricing (Free/Pro/Elite with Pro emphasized), and Final CTA with the exact required text/labels.
- Add smooth fade-in on-scroll animations for major sections and subtle hover/focus glow effects for interactive elements.
- Wire CTA buttons to smooth on-page scrolling: “See How It Works” scrolls to How It Works; “Start Your Launch” and “Launch with IDEAZS Now” scroll to one consistent target section (Pricing or Final CTA).

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can view a responsive, modern IDEAZS landing page with animated premium visuals, scroll-in section animations, and CTA buttons that smoothly navigate to key sections on the page.
